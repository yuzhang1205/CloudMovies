    <summary />
    <releaseNotes>Changes in 7.2:
* Updated AspNetCore integration to support IValidatableObject
* Updated AspNetCore integration to allow mixing multiple validation strategies in the same model
* Updated AspNetCore integration to support RulesetForClientsideMessagesAttribute
* Fix - Property names were not generated properly for nested types when using AddFailure inside a Custom validator
* Fix - NullReferenceException when using CustomAsync but the validator is invoked synchronously
* Fix - Clientside integration in AspNetCore being resolved from the root-level service provider
* Fix - Allow empty string to be passed to OverridePropertyName 

Changes in 7.1.1:
* Fix - Incorrect property name was generated when using RuleForEach combined with SetValidator
* Fix - Nesting async validators inside DependentRules didn't wait for completion

Changes in 7.1:
* New RuleFor().Custom() method as a replacement for the old, deprecated Custom method
* Improved messages in the ShouldHaveChildValidator test extension   
* Test helper works with nested properties
* Additional overload of WithState allows access to collection item when used with RuleForEach 
* Fix - Wrong values were generated as part of the MVC5 clientside integration for MinLength and MaxLength validators
* Fix - AssemblyScanner now excludes abstract and generic types
* Fix - InvalidCastException when using lazy WithMessage combined with RuleForEach
* WithState enhanced to allow access to the ValidationContext

Changes in 7.0:

7.0 is a major release that contains several breaking changes, especially with Localization. If you use FluentValidation's support for localization please read the updated documentation: https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation/wiki/f.-Localization

* Localization rewrite to not require satellite assemblies
* New 'Custom' rule method replaces the root-level Custom method
* Switch to Netstandard based build process
* Assemblies are now signed / strongly named - see https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation/wiki/l.-Strong-naming-and-signed-packages
* Fix - Possible NullReferenceException in the AspNetCore clientside integration for length validators
* Fix - Don't clear the ModelValidatorProviders collection by default in the AspNetCore integration (added new ClearValidatorProviders property to control this behaviour)
* Fix - Ensure IValidatorFactory is resolved from request scope in asp.net core integration
* Fix - Property getter that throws an exception causes validation to fail in WebApi integration
* Fix - Issue in AspNetCore integration where we tried to resolve a collection validator in some situations where a class validator should be used
* Fix - Incorrect clientside validation attributes generated for email validator and credit card validator in the asp.net core integration
* Fix - Child model validation now works in webapi integration
* Improve splitting of PascalCased property names to support uppercase character sequences
* ValidationResult.ErrorCode property now always returns the type of the PropertyValidator that generated the message, unless it's been explicitly overriden
